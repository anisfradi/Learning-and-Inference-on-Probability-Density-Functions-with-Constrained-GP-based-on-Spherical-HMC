## Project Description

This demo showcases the "Learning and Inference on Probability Density Functions with Constrained GP based on Spherical HMC" method, which combines the advantages of constrained GP and the spherical Hamiltonian Monte Carlo sampling in order to learn data belongin to the space of probability density functions.

## Installation

To run this Python demo, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open jupyter notebook and navigate to the project directory.
3. Run the `demo.ipynb` file to execute the code.
4. Follow the instructions in the demo to explore and analyze the results.

Make sure you have Python installed and any required dependencies are properly set up.

## Usage

The demo provides a user-friendly interface for demonstrating the "Nonparametric Statistical Testing for Spherical Data" method. It allows users to load their own data or use preloaded example datasets. The demo code provides clear instructions and explanations of the method's functionalities. Users can modify the parameters and settings to experiment with different scenarios. Alternatively, theÂ `demo_test_double.ipynb` is an option for test of double spherical means.
